############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

# The deck is unlimited in size.
# There are no jokers.
# The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

# Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
# Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

# Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
# Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

# Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

# Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
# 11 is the Ace.

import random

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# cards = [10, 11, 10]


def deal_card():
    return random.choice(cards)


# Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
user_cards = []
computer_cards = []

user_cards.append(deal_card())
user_cards.append(deal_card())

computer_cards.append(deal_card())
computer_cards.append(deal_card())
# Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
# and returns the score.
# Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

# Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

# Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

game_over = False


def calculate_score(user_hand, computer_hand):
    score = []

    def check_ace(hand):
        if 11 in hand:
            if sum(hand) > 21:
                hand.remove(11)
                hand.append(1)

    check_ace(hand=user_hand)
    user_score = sum(user_hand)

    check_ace(hand=computer_hand)
    computer_score = sum(computer_hand)

    def blackjack(hand):
        if len(hand) == 2 and sum(hand) == 21:
            return 0

    if blackjack(user_hand) == 0:
        user_score = 0
    if blackjack(computer_hand) == 0:
        computer_score = 0

    score.append(user_score)
    score.append(computer_score)

    print(f"Your Cards {user_hand}, current score: {user_score}")
    print(
        f"computer's first card {computer_hand[0]} computer score: {computer_score}")
    return score


score = calculate_score(user_cards, computer_cards)

user_score = score[0]
computer_score = score[1]


def is_blackjack(u_score, c_score):

    if u_score == 0 or u_score > 21:
        return True
    elif c_score == 0 or c_score > 21:
        return True
    else:
        return False


game_over = is_blackjack(u_score=user_score, c_score=computer_score)

print(game_over)

# Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

# Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

if game_over == False:
    # hit = input("Do you want to draw another card? 'y' or 'n' ")
    hit = 'y'
    if hit == 'y':
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        score = calculate_score(user_cards, computer_cards)
# Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

# Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

# Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

# Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
